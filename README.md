I have created comprehensive Project in Power BI to create multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data wrangling using Power Query, and data visualization

# Description: This project focused on analyzing HR data to gain insights into employee performance, retention rates, and workforce trends. By leveraging data-driven approaches, the analysis helped organizations improve talent management strategies, enhance employee satisfaction, and reduce attrition. Conduct an in-depth analysis of HR data to uncover key insights into employee performance, retention rates, and workforce trends. The findings supported data-driven decision-making in talent management and employee satisfaction strategies

# insights gained from analysis:
1.	Majority of attrition comes from Married individuals (48.8%), followed by Single (37.01%), and Divorced (14.17%). Single employees have the highest attrition count, with females having a slightly higher attrition rate than males.
2.	The highest attrition rate is in the 25-30 age group , followed by 30-35 , and 18-25 age group. The 35-42 & >42 age group has the lowest attrition rate.
3.	Individuals from Life Sciences has the highest attrition rate (93), followed by Medical (69), and Marketing (38). The Human Resources field has the lowest attrition rate (7).
4.	Research & Development department has the highest attrition count (56.69%), followed by Sales (38.4%), and Human Resources (4.72%). And the highest attrition count comes from Research & Development department with Married employees (32).
5.	Sales Representative has the highest attrition count (66), followed by Laboratory Technician (62), and Manufacturing Director (51). The Research Director role has the lowest attrition count (2).
6.	Sales department has the highest attrition count, with the 5k-10k salary slab having the highest number of attritions.
7.	The line chart shows a general trend of increasing attrition with decreasing job satisfaction. The highest attrition occurs at a job satisfaction level of 2, while the lowest is at 4.
8.	Attrition is highest for employees who have worked in 2-3 companies. This might indicate that employees with a certain level of experience are more likely to switch jobs.
9.	Majority of attrition comes from employees with a performance rating of 3 (83.07%), followed by 4 (16.93%). This might suggest that employees who are not performing well are more likely to leave.
10.	Attrition is highest for employees with 0-1 years of experience and then gradually decreases with increasing experience. This might indicate that new hires are more likely to leave the company.
11. Attrition Count is highest for employees with a work-life balance rating of 1 and 2. This might indicate that employees who are not satisfied with their work-life balance are more likely to leave.
12.	Majority of attrition comes from employees who do not work overtime (51.9%). And Sales department has the highest attrition count, with both overtime and non-overtime employees having significant numbers.

# Recommendations:
1. Focus on Married Employees and Single Females: Develop specific retention programs or initiatives for married employees and single females, as they seem to be more prone to attrition. Implement flexible work arrangements, childcare subsidies, or stress management programs to address potential work-life balance issues.
2. Prioritize the >35 Age Group: Provide opportunities for career advancement and skill development to retain valuable employees in this age group. Implement mentorship programs to help employees in this age group navigate career transitions and challenges.
3. Address Attrition in Life Sciences and Medical Fields: Ensure that compensation and benefits packages are competitive to retain talent in these high-demand fields. Offer professional development opportunities and certifications to keep employees engaged and motivated.
4. Improve Retention in Research & Development: Implement recognition programs and rewards to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of employees in this department.
5. Focus on High-Attrition Job Roles: Ensure that job roles are clearly defined and expectations are communicated effectively. Implement effective performance management systems to provide regular feedback and coaching.
6. Address Low Job Satisfaction: Conduct regular employee surveys to gauge job satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
7. Monitor Attrition Patterns by Experience Level: Invest in robust onboarding and training programs for new hires to help them integrate smoothly. Assign mentors to new hires to provide guidance and support.
8. Improve Work-Life Balance: Offer flexible work arrangements like remote work or flexible hours to help employees manage their work-life balance.
9. Overtime : Review overtime policies to ensure that they are fair and equitable. Implement effective workload management strategies to reduce overtime.

By addressing these areas, you can improve retention and reduce attrition within the organization. Remember to track the impact of these recommendations and make adjustments as needed.
